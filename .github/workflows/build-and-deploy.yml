# This workflow will build and push a .NET Core application to an Azure Function on every push to the master branch.
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set up a secret in your repository named AZURE_DEPLOY_CREDS with a value of the json result of a new service principal, scoped to the given resource group
# For additional information follow the instructions here https://github.com/Azure/login
#
# 2. Change the values for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME, AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH and NETCORE_VERSION environment variables  (below).
#
